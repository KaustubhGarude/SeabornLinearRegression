# SeabornLinearRegression
regplot() function of seaborn only gives the regression plot but you cannot find the equation of the line using seaborn \n
I found the insight from Answer #2 of https://www.py4u.net/discuss/184199 \n
I have created the code for finding slope, y-intercept, R - Square and Adjusted R - Squared \n
I will add more functions as I learn more \n

Cheers!
