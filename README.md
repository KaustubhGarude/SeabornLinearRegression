# SeabornLinearRegression
regplot() function of seaborn only gives the regression plot but you cannot find the equation of the line using seaborn
I found the insight from Answer #2 of https://www.py4u.net/discuss/184199 
I have created the code for finding slope, y-intercept, R - Square and Adjusted R - Squared
I will add more functions as I learn more

Cheers!
